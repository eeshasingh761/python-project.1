# ⁠How can you store data persistently using files or a database in Python?

# Ask how many users to enter
num_users = int(input("How many users do you want to enter? "))

# Open file to write
with open("user_data.txt", "w") as file:
    for i in range(num_users):
        name = input("Enter name: ")
        age = input("Enter age: ")
        email = input("Enter email: ")
        file.write(f"{name},{age},{email}\n")

# Read and print the data from file
print("\nSaved Users in File:")
with open("user_data.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
